    <p>Bare, hard-coded minimum:<br>
    – remind me to include sources of certain vitamins<br>
    – with a set interval<br>
    – and give a reference list to choose top foods from</p>
    – set: Iron > every 3 days > "Include some source of Iron today"<br>
    – Beef, chicken liver, white beans, spinach<br>
    – show cats - show me only vegs, fruits, meat, milk products, all vegetable sources<br>

    <p>I am low on Vitamin C, what should I eat today?</p>
    – Kiwi<br>
    – Apple<br>
    – Tomato<br>
    <p>How much should I eat to cover my need?</p>
    – 4 Kiwi<br>
    – 8 Apples<br>
    – 12 Tomatoes<br>
    <p>What can I pair it with (not to eat 12 tomatoes)?</p>
    - combinations<br>
    <p>I am also lacking Calcium, what should I do?</p>
    - pair foods that relate well to each other on the plate (taste, relations in recipes)<br>
    - take into account how much of the nutrients will be absorbed if the foods are paired<br>
    <p>If I ate a tomato and 2 boiled potatoes, what else am I missing for today?</p>
    - eat these foods to get all the essentials today<br>
    - suggest foods for the next couple days<br>
    <p>I have no time, I'll go for a night eating out. What should I pick?</p>
    - suggest meals that fit best, closest locations and deliveries<br>
    <p>Here are some popular recipes, what are they?</p>
    - basically, take tomato soup, why do we eat it? why do we need it? I'm wondering, is it useful at all? Break down recipes into nutrients.
    <p>Some margin of error and ranges for micronutrients</p>
    <p>Very general breakdown for macronutrients (ratio), with no particular goal</p>
    <p>In a nutshell, these are dietary recommendations. They are interactive and come in real time.<br>
      They help minimize deficiencies, and also cover extra needs of a particular lifestyle (needs of athlets, p.e.)
