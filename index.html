    <p>New min:<br>
    - ask me what I do what to eat (chicken)<br>
    - suggest a pairing food (ingredient) (potato)<br>
    - that can be skipped (quinoa, barley etc.)<br>
    - these ingredients top the list for certain nutritional needs, by evaluation of micronutrient content</p>
    <p>Bare, hard-coded minimum:<br>
    – platform - mobile, an iOS app<br>
    – <span class="str muted">no accounts, local storage</span><br>
    – set up once, <span class="str muted">come back when notified</span>, come back when you do grocery or cook + notification reminders about vitamins<p>
    <p>– remind me to include sources of certain vitamins, pick only a few to start with (Iron, B6, B12, Vit C, e.g.)<br>
    – with a set interval<br>
    – when reminding give <b>a reference list to choose top foods from (if I need Vit C, what should i eat)</b></p>
    – set: Iron > every 3 days > "Include some source of Iron today"<br>
    – list: Beef, chicken liver, white beans, spinach etc.<br>
    – item: Spinach: A cup of cooked spinach<br>
    – show cats - show me only vegs, fruits, meat, milk products, fish, grains, all vegetable sources<br>
    <br><br>
    <p>Why? Mental health is dependable on nutrition and is impaired by deficiencies. Memory is affected. Attention and performance at certain tasks can be improved, age-related memory and cognition decline slowed.</p>
    <p>What else is important? Water, probiotic foods, what else?</p>
    <br><br>
    <p></p>
    <p>I am low on Vitamin C, what should I eat today?</p>
    – Kiwi<br>
    – Apple<br>
    – Tomato<br>
    <p>How much should I eat to cover my need?</p>
    – 4 Kiwi<br>
    – 8 Apples<br>
    – 12 Tomatoes<br>
    <p><b>What can I pair it with</b> (not to eat 12 tomatoes, or 5 cups of spinach)?</p>
    - combinations of foods instead of recipe titles (spinach <b>AND</b> chicken liver, apples <b>AND</b> oranges)<br>
    <p>I am also lacking Calcium, what should I do?</p>
    - pair foods that relate well to each other on the plate (taste, relations in recipes)<br>
    - take into account how much of the nutrients will be absorbed if the foods are paired<br>
    <p><b>If I ate a tomato and 2 boiled potatoes, what else am I missing for today</p>
    - eat these foods to get all the essentials today<br>
    - suggest foods for the next couple days</b><br>
    <p>Help me put together a shopping list for a week or a few days (because that's when I decide what I'll be eating, by putting it into my cart), but show me meals (recipes) that I might cook with it</p>
    <p>I have no time, I'll go for a night eating out. What should I pick?</p>
    - suggest meals that fit best, closest locations and deliveries<br>
    <p>Here are some popular recipes, what are they?</p>
    - basically, take tomato soup, why do we eat it? why do we need it? I'm wondering, is it useful at all? Break down recipes into nutrients.
    <p>Some margin of error and ranges for micronutrients</p>
    <p>Very general breakdown for macronutrients (ratio), with no particular goal</p>
    <p>In a nutshell, <b>these are dietary recommendations</b>. They are interactive and come <b>in real time</b>.<br>
      They help minimize deficiencies, and also cover extra needs, of a particular lifestyle or age (needs of athlets, elder people, kids, babies, some conditions like acne etc.)
    </p>
    <p>Efficient, fast, optimized in comparison with human choice<br>
    Top foods lists, rations, like the ones I had on my walls and cupboard doors and in my notes<br>
    Helps introduce new foods, like new sorts of fish or asian vegetables, if they better suit your goal<br>
    Positive interventions, add this rather than limit that, help learn about natural, wholesome foods</p>
